      <link>http://www.movies.com/robocop/m67710?wssac=123&amp;wssaffid=TTBO</link>
      <description><![CDATA[A powerful multinational conglomerate attempts to bring robotic law enforcement to the United States by transforming a critically injured police officer into a cyborg cop in this remake of the subversive 1987 sci-fi classic. The year is 2028. For a long time, cutting-edge robotics company OmniCorp has been supplying the U.S. military with drones for use overseas, though their repeated attempts to bring the technology stateside has met with fierce resistance. When devoted family man and upstanding Detroit policeman Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is grievously wounded in the line of duty, OmniCorp CEO Raymond Sellars (Michael Keaton) attempts to innovate by recruiting top scientist Dennett Norton (Gary Oldman) to transform Murphy into a prototype half-man/half-robot crime-fighter. When initial tests fail to provide the results OmniCorp had hoped for, Norton reprograms Robocop to operate strictly on software rather than human emotion. Later, Robocop finally hits the streets, and the citizens of the crime-ridden city welcome him with open arms. But as Murphy's emotions begin to interfere with his programming, he sets out to find the criminals who nearly killed him, and ensure that justice is served. Abbie Cornish, Samuel L. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, and Jackie Earle Haley co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Cowriter and director George Clooney adapts author Robert M. Edsel's book The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History to tell the incredible true story of the seven art historians and museum curators who went behind enemy lines during World War II on a mission to recover some of the world's greatest works of art. With war raging in Europe, the Nazis have managed to plunder some of the biggest art collections on the continent. As the Third Reich begins to topple, the German army receives explicit orders that in the event of Adolf Hitler's death, they are to destroy every work of art in their possession. Determined to prevent 1000 years of culture from going up in flames, American president Franklin D. Roosevelt approves a proposal by Frank Stokes (Clooney) to form a task force comprised entirely of art experts to enter Germany, recover the works of art, and ensure they are returned to their rightful owners. With little knowledge of modern weapons or warfare tactics, the ragtag squadron has their work cut out for them. Cate Blanchett, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and Jean Dujardin also star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi]]></description>
